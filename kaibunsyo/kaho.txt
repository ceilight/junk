You know they say all idols are created equal, but you look
at Kaho and you look at Koito and you can see that
statement is NOT TRUE! See, normally if you go one-on-one
with another idol you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But
Kaho is a genetic freak, and she's NOT NORMAL! So Koito
got a 25% at best at beating her! And then you add Asahi
to the mix? Koito's chances of winning drastically go down.
See, the three-way at W.I.N.G., you got a 33 1/3 chance of
winning. But Kaho—Kaho got a 66 2/3 chance of winning,
'cause Asahi KNOOOWS she can't beat Kaho, and she's not
even gonna try. So, Koito, you take your 33 1/3 chance
minus Kaho's 25% chance, and you got an 8 1/3 chance of
winning at W.I.N.G.. But then you take Kaho's 75% chance of
winning (if they were to go one on one), and then add 66
2/3 cha—percent, Kaho got a 141 2/3 chance of winning at
W.I.N.G.! Señorita Koito, the numbers don't lie, and they
spell DISASTER for you at W.I.N.G.!
